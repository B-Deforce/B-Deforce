### Welcome to My GitHub Page!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I recently obtained my PhD developing machine learning solutions for real-world time-series problems at [KU Leuven LIRIS](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/decision-sciences-and-information-management/liris/liris) and at Carnegie Mellon University. I worked on time-series forecasting and anomaly detection with sensor data. My research focused on developing innovative methods that enhance the reliability and efficiency of complex systems.

ðŸ’¬ [Chat with my PhD thesis](https://mainpy-7d8mfhrvogmu7jywq5xzwx.streamlit.app/) or access the pdf [here](https://kuleuven.limo.libis.be/discovery/search?query=any,contains,LIRIAS4233901&tab=LIRIAS&search_scope=lirias_profile&vid=32KUL_KUL:Lirias&offset=0).

ðŸš€ Alongside my academic pursuits, I also started an eyewear company during my PhD, called [Naos Optics](https://www.naos-optics.com).
Previously, I've worked at Deloitte as a data scientist/consultant and at Amazon as an Applied Scientist II (internship).
