### Welcome to My GitHub Page!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I recently obtained my PhD developing machine learning solutions for real-world problems at [KU Leuven LIRIS](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/decision-sciences-and-information-management/liris/liris) and I also worked at Carnegie Mellon University. I worked on time-series forecasting and anomaly detection within the Internet of Things (IoT) context. My research focused on developing innovative methods that enhance the reliability and efficiency of IoT systems.

ðŸš€ Alongside my academic pursuits, I also run an eyewear company, called [Naos Optics](https://www.naos-optics.com).
Previously, I've worked at Deloitte and Amazon.
