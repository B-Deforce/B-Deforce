### Welcome to My GitHub Page!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a PhD student at [KU Leuven LIRIS](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/decision-sciences-and-information-management/liris/liris), focusing on machine learning applications and development, specifically time-series forecasting and anomaly detection within the Internet of Things (IoT) context. My research aims to develop innovative methods that enhance the reliability and efficiency of IoT systems.

ðŸš€ Alongside my academic pursuits, I also run an eyewear company, called [Naos Optics](www.naos-optics.com).
